We accumulate and retain documentation for very old versions of Microsoft SQL Server in a set of _archive_ webpages. The archived webpages are not processed by search engines, such as Bing.com and Google.com. But you can see these archives at our Docs _previous-versions/_ address:

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/)

These archives include the documentation for at least the following older versions:

- SQL Server 2014
- SQL Server 2012
- SQL Server 2008 R2
- SQL Server 2008
- SQL Server 2005

[SQL Server 2014 documentation](/previous-versions/sql/2014/index?view=sql-server-2014) has been archived, and is no longer processed by search engines. The 2014 articles now declare themselves with NOINDEX and NOFOLLOW.

The latest version of SQL Server, along with other recent versions, is documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/sql-server/index).
