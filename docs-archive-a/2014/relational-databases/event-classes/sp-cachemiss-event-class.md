# SP:CacheMiss Event Class
  The SP:CacheMiss event class indicates that the procedure is not found in the cache. If the SP:CacheMiss event class occurs frequently, it can indicate that more memory should be made available to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], thereby increasing the size of the procedure cache.  
  
## SP:CacheMiss Event Class Data Columns  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|  
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|  
|ApplicationName|`nvarchar`|Name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|10|Yes|  
|ClientProcessID|`int`|ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the client process ID.|9|Yes|  
|DatabaseID|`int`|ID of the database in which the stored procedure is running. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|EventClass|`int`|Type of event = 34.|27|No|  
|EventSequence|`int`|Sequence of a given event within the request.|51|No|  
|GroupID|`int`|ID of the workload group where the SQL Trace event fires.|66|Yes|  
|HostName|`nvarchar`|Name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the host name. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|8|Yes|  
|IsSystem|`int`|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process. 1 = system, 0 = user.|60|Yes|  
|LoginName|`nvarchar`|Name of the login of the user (either [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security login or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows login credentials in the form of DOMAIN\username).|11|Yes|  
|LoginSid|`image`|Security identification number (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the sys.server_principals catalog view. Each SID is unique for each login in the server.|41|Yes|  
|NTDomainName|`nvarchar`|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|7|Yes|  
|NTUserName|`nvarchar`|Windows user name.|6|Yes|  
|ObjectID|`int`|System-assigned ID of the object.|22|Yes|  
|ObjectName|`nvarchar`|Name of the stored procedure. If ObjectName is populated, then TextData will not be populated.|34|Yes|  
|ObjectType|`int`|Value representing the type of the object involved in the event. This value corresponds to the type column in the sys.objects catalog view. For values, see [ObjectType Trace Event Column](objecttype-trace-event-column.md).|28|Yes|  
|RequestID|`int`|ID of the request containing the statement.|49|Yes|  
|ServerName|`nvarchar`|Name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] being traced.|26|No|  
|SessionLoginName|`nvarchar`|Login name of the user who originated the session. For example, if you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Login1 and execute a statement as Login2, SessionLoginName shows Login1 and LoginName shows Login2. This column displays both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows logins.|64|Yes|  
|SPID|`int`|ID of the session on which the event occurred.|12|Yes|  
|StartTime|`datetime`|Time at which the event started, if available.|14|Yes|  
|TextData|`ntext`|Text of the SQL code that is being cached. If TextData is populated, ObjectName is not populated.|1|Yes|  
|TransactionID|`bigint`|System-assigned ID of the transaction.|4|Yes|  
|XactSequence|`bigint`|Token that describes the current transaction.|50|Yes|
